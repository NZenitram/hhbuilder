# Ad-Hoc HHBuilder

Ad-Hoc HHBuilder is a Javascript/HTML webpage that allows its users to create a list of household members from a provided form by selecting the person's age, relationship to the user, and if that member is a smoker. When a family member is saved by clicking the `add` button, that information is persisted in the browser's localStorage. When the `submit` button is clicked, the JSON data for all of the family members on the page is appended to the `debug` element. This was done to mimic a submission to a live database in the proper format.
